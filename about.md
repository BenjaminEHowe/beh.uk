I am an adaptable developer with experience using a variety of tools and languages.
In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies and working on various side projects, as well as railways, musicals, and long countryside walks.

I am a member of [the British Computer Society](https://www.bcs.org/) and abide by [its Code of Conduct](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/).
If you believe I may have breached the code then please don't hesitate to [get in touch with me](https://www.beh.uk/contact), alternatively the issue can be [reported directly to the BCS](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/dealing-with-a-breach-of-the-code/).
