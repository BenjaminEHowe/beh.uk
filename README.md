# [www.beh.uk](https://www.beh.uk)

Benjamin Howe's personal website, [deployed to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/beh/deploys). Originally generated from [the blank Jekyll template](https://github.com/BenjaminEHowe/jekyll-blank).

## Installation

[Install Ruby and Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), then clone this repository in a convenient location. In the future it might be nice to have these dependencies within a container ([there's a GitHub issue for that](https://github.com/BenjaminEHowe/beh.uk/issues/21)).

Install gems using `bundle install`.

## Usage

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000.

## Tests

Sadly there aren't any, yet, at least. I plan to fix this!

## Contributing

I don't expect anyone else to contribute to my website, but if you'd like to then feel free to submit a pull request.
