title: "Full Fibre Broadband FAQs"
categories: networking

I've written this blog post because I've had a number of people ask me questions about "full fibre" broadband. I'm hoping that it'll answer some common questions, as well as perhaps helping readers consider things which they hadn't previously thought of.

## Openreach are installing "full fibre" in my area -- what does this mean for me?

- first networks designed for the internet (telephone lines were for telephones, the cable network is for TV)
- openreach build target?
- initial consumer speeds of up to 1Gb, but the physical fibres are capable of much faster speeds (e.g. Nokia 100Gb PON)

## Don't I already have fibre?

- FTTC isn't full fibre
- ASA ruling

## Where will the cables go?

_this section will mostly focus on blocks of flats_

- probably where the old ones were!
- mention tobys
- for flats, the internal routing is to be agreed with whoever granted the wayleave (cables will probably still follow the previous route)

## Where will the fibre appear in my property?

- probably where the existing master socket is!
- note on special installation services / internal cabling

## How does full fibre affect my landline telephone?

- it's complicated -- unlike FTTC, FTTP doesn't use a telephone line
- end of conventional "telephone" lines in 2025 regardless
- telephone using mobile
- telephone using ISP
- telephone using VoIP

## Why are different companies digging up the roads to install fibre?

- competition
- consolidation
- PIA

## I don't need more speed -- why should I care about full fibre?

- "you get what you pay for"
- reduced latency
- reduced jitter
- fewer faults

## Which speed should I order?

- highlight the openreach packages (and that altnets vary)
- 50Mb per person download and 10mb per person upload
- limitations of wifi

## Does full fibre help with working from home?

_this section will both highlight the increased reliability of full fibre and the limitations of "broadband" style products_

- increased reliability
- existing SLAs apply
- contention
- improvement using 4G
- alternatively use a leased line

## Is full fibre more expensive than my current broadband?

- often the same price
- lower operating costs
- Openreach Equinox offer
- altnets might be cheaper!
