_Disclaimer: while I am [#ActuallyAutistic](https://autism.wikia.org/wiki/ActuallyAutistic), the autistic community is a diverse collection of individuals -- although I believe the contents of this post are generally applicable, please give precedence to other individuals or groups where applicable._

As we approach [World Autism Awareness Week](https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/raise-money/world-autism-awareness-week) I'm aware that some people aren't sure what words they should use when talking about autistic people. In this post I'll address a few common questions and explain why some language choices are preferred. I've written this post to supplement, not replace, the [National Autistic Society's guidance on how to talk and write about autism](https://www.autism.org.uk/what-we-do/help-and-support/how-to-talk-about-autism).

## Neurodiverse / Neurotypical

Neurodiverse or neurodivergant people are individuals who have neurological differences such as Autism, Dyslexia, or ADHD. Conversely, neurotypical people do not have these differences, although sometimes the term "neurotypical" is used to indicate the lack of a specific difference -- for example, an autistic community may use "neurotypical" to indicate people who do not have autism, but may have other neurological differences. These differences may be detected through tests for things like verbal and non-verbal reasoning, information processing speed, and executive function, however some neurodiverse people have learned to mask their traits in order to fit in a generally unaccommodating world.

## Identity-first / Person-first Language

"Identity-first" or "person-first" language is used to describe people. "Identity-first" language puts the condition first -- "autistic people". "Person-first" language puts the person first -- "people with autism". Although both descriptions are valid, autistic people generally prefer identity-first language (i.e. "autistic people" not "people with autism"), however this can be a very individual choice. The [Autistic Self Advocacy Network](https://autisticadvocacy.org/) has an excellent [post explaining identity-first and person-first language in more detail](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/identity-first-language/).

## Treatment / "Cures"

Autism is a permanent disability (not an illness). There is no known "cure" and many autistic people see their autism as a core part of who they are, and therefore do not seek a "cure". Autistic people won't "grow out" of their autism, although as they get older they may become better at masking some of their traits. While some autistic people will take medication, many do not. When talking about supporting autistic people, think about "adjustments" or "accommodations", not "treatments".

## Causes

It is not clear what causes autism, however we know that autism is not caused by:
- bad parenting
- vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine
- diet
- an infection you can spread to other people
- gluten
- a lack of hugs

 (source: [NHS "What is Autism?"](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/what-is-autism/))

 Autistic people find the suggestion that autism may be caused by the MMR vaccine (or vaccines in general) particularly offensive due to the implication that being autistic but immune tu measles, mumps, and rubella is worse than being [susceptable to one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable death](https://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/MI_Fact%20Sheet_17_jan_2007.pdf).

## "Functioning" Labels

Historically autistic people were described as "high functioning" and "low functioning", however this over-simplifies the autistic spectrum. Rebecca Burgess' [comic "Understanding the Spectrum"](https://the-art-of-autism.com/understanding-the-spectrum-a-comic-strip-explanation/) is an excellent explanation, but in short the autistic spectrum is more complicated than a linear range and autistic people may struggle more or less due to a variety of factors, such as how well they slept recently and what accommodations are offered to them. For the same reasons describing autism as "mild" or "severe" is often frowned upon -- in most cases it is better to focus on the specific trait that is relevant (e.g. personally I would describe myself as having poor fine motor skills).

## Aspergers / Autism

Aspergers was the term historically used to "describe autistic people with average or above average intelligence", however the term is no longer used -- it was [removed from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/02/aspergers-syndrome-dropped-psychiatric-dsm) and will be [removed from the 2022 (11th) edition of the WHO's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems](https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/people-mourn-asperger-syndromes-loss-diagnostic-manuals/). There are [a variety of reasons for abolishing the term "Aspergers"](https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/why-fold-asperger-syndrome-into-autism-spectrum-disorder-in-the-dsm-5/), especially [Hans Asperger's problematic association wth Nazism](https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-018-0208-6).

## Conclusion

I hope this article will be useful in choosing the right words and expressions to use when talking about autistic people. I welcome [feedback via my contact form](https://www.beh.uk/contact).
